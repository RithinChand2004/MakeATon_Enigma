Title: Project Sanjaya uvacha: Helping People See with Their Ears
<br>
Abstract:
Project Sanjaya uvacha is an initiative focused on improving the quality of life and opportunities for differently abled individuals and the elderly. The project's core objective is to develop an innovative and user-friendly mobile application that empowers visually impaired individuals to navigate their surroundings and comprehend objects within their environment using auditory feedback. Leveraging cutting-edge technology, the application utilizes computer vision and machine learning algorithms for real-time object recognition and auditory information synthesis. The system ensures full environmental awareness by enabling precise identification and retrieval of information about objects, facilitating detailed comparisons. Furthermore, it incorporates a danger detection feature that identifies harmful objects and alerts the user, enhancing safety. The application is designed to be voice command driven, allowing users to interact with the system effortlessly. The proposed system not only enriches the daily experiences of differently abled and elderly individuals but also fosters a more inclusive and accessibleÂ society.
